# ENDEFILE

_(The main purpose of this project is to get practice in golang and some of the packages, so if you happened to come accross this project and have some feedback, it'd be welcome.)_

EndeFile is a simple program that will compress your folder into a .tar.gz and encrypt it into a .enc, and of course the reverse process, decrypt the .enc file and decompress the .tar.gz.

## Flags

-compress
-decompress
-folder <folder-path>

## Todo

- The compression part is pretty insignificant. I will research a bit about compression algorithms and other packages available on the wild.
- Add more flags for operation convenience.
- Add tests. (x.x)
- Optimize the current code.
